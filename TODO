TODO:
1. Revise the behaviors of:
	a) Parentheses matching
	b) Square brackets matching
	c) Curly braces matching
   - These three's behaviors are not correct.
   - They are not block-aware [idk the word]
     (they don't know if they are inside another set of parentheses / brackets
	  / braces)
   - Example:
   -- int main()
   -- {
   --     printf("%d\n", 4*(2 + 3*(6 / 3)));
   -- }
   - The parentheses inside `printf`'s second argument is `nested` inside one
     another. They need to be aware to what they are matched to, not just
	 from index-counting.
